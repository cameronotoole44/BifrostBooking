# Bifröst Bookings

## Introduction

**Bifröst Bookings** is an innovative flight booking application designed to streamline the process of finding and reserving flights. Named after the mythical rainbow bridge, Bifröst, that connects the realms in Norse mythology, this application aims to bridge the gap between travelers and their dream destinations.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind **Bifröst Bookings** came from the stress, challenges, and inconveniences often faced while booking flights. I wanted to create a platform that not only makes the booking process easy and efficient but also adds a touch of elegance and modernity through a sleek user interface and seamless user experience. This project also serves as a showcase of my skills with React, Redux, and PostgreSQL, creating a full-stack application.

## Current Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login for users to manage their bookings.
- **User Profiles:** Allowing users to create and manage profiles with saved preferences and past bookings.
- **Flight Search:** Users can search for flights based on departure city, arrival city, departure date, return date, and number of passengers.
- **Booking Management:** Users can view their bookings and manage them as needed.

## Currently Working On

This project is currently a work in progress on all fronts. Some of the current tasks include:

- **Connecting Backend:** Establishing the database with PostgreSQL and managing backend operations.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Developing an admin panel to manage flights, bookings, and users.
- **Improved Search:** Enhancing the search functionality to provide more accurate and faster results.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Continuously improving the design and usability of the application to ensure a smooth user experience.
