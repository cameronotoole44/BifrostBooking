# Bifröst Bookings

## Introduction

Welcome to **Bifröst Bookings** – your gateway to seamless flight reservations! Inspired by the legendary rainbow bridge from Norse mythology, Bifröst, this app bridges the gap between travelers and their dream destinations with ease and efficiency.

## Inspiration

**Bifröst Bookings** emerged from a blend of my passion for full-stack development and the desire to alleviate the hassles of flight booking.
